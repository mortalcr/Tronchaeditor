## Usage

To use TronchaEditor for editing MiniGo code, follow these steps:

Download and install TronchaEditor from the releases page.

Add the [MiniGo compiler's](https://github.com/zSnails/minigo) directory to your system's PATH environment variable. This step is necessary for TronchaEditor to locate the MiniGo compiler and provide code completion and error checking.

For example, if MiniGo is installed in /path/to/minigo, you would add /path/to/minigo to your PATH environment variable. The exact steps to do this vary depending on your operating system:

#### Windows:

* Right-click on "This PC" or "Computer" in the File Explorer and select "Properties".
* Click on "Advanced system settings" in the sidebar.
* In the System Properties window, click on "Environment Variables".
* In the Environment Variables window, under "System variables" or "User variables", find the "Path" variable and click "Edit".
* Add a new entry with the path to the MiniGo compiler's directory (e.g., C:\path\to\minigo).
* Click "OK" to save the changes.
You may need to restart any open command prompts or applications for the changes to take effect.

#### Mac/Linux:

* Open a terminal.
* Edit your shell's configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc for Bash) and add the following line:

***bash***

    sudo ln -s /path/to/minigo/minigo /usr/local/bin/minigo

*   Save the file and run the following command to apply the changes:
  
  ***bash***

    source ~/.bashrc

Launch TronchaEditor and start coding in MiniGo!
